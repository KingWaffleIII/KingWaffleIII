### Hi there!

I'm primarily focused in Django and its REST framework, Spigot plugin development and Discord.JS, love TypeScript and want to learn Rust.

### Languages:
1. TypeScript
2. Python
3. Rust
4. Java
5. JavaScript

## Projects
- [Plane](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/plane), a Discord bot to help RAF cadets with their RAFK (RAF Knowledge) and aircraft recognition.
- [Chihayaburu](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/chihayaburu), a Discord bot that automates HoYoLab Genshin Impact check-ins.
- [Cashmoney](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/cashmoney), a simple Django web-based job/shift finance management app.

### WIP
- TIDMAS, a key-based cipher using maths.
- [Kommander](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/kommander), a Django web-based SSH and proprietary remote access server/client.
- ???, a mobile app, powered by Tauri, that listens for and recognises any playing surahs in the background (like Shazam).
