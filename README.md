### Hi there!

**I'm KingWaffleIII, a student who's interested in planes and web technologies.**
I'm primarily focused in Django and its REST framework but love TypeScript, Discord.JS and want to get into Rust.

My main projects are:
- [Plane](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/plane), a niche Discord bot to help RAF cadets with their RAFK (RAF Knowledge) and aircraft recognition.
- [Kommander](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/kommander), a Django web-based SSH and proprietary remote access server/client.
- [Apollo](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/apollo), a simple Django web-based job shift finance management app.
