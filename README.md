### Hi there!

**I'm KingWaffleIII, a student who's interested in planes and web technologies.**
I'm primarily focused in Django and its REST framework but love TypeScript, Discord.JS and want to get into Rust.

My main projects are:
- Plane, a niche Discord bot to help RAF cadets with their RAFK (RAF Knowledge) and aircraft recognition.
- Kommander, a Django web-based SSH and proprietary remote access server/client.
- Apollo, a simple Django web-based job shift finance management app.
