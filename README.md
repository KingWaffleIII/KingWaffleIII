### Hi there!

**I'm KingWaffleIII, a student who's interested in aviation and web technologies.**
I'm primarily focused in Django and its REST framework, Spigot plugin development and Discord.JS.

### Languages:
1. TypeScript (JavaScript)
2. Python
3. Rust
4. Kotlin


## Projects
- [Plane](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/plane), a Discord bot to help RAF cadets with their RAFK (RAF Knowledge) and aircraft recognition.
- [Chihayaburu](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/chihayaburu), a Discord bot that automates HoYoLab Genshin Impact check-ins.
- [Cashmoney](https://github.com/KingWaffleIII/cashmoney), a simple Django web-based job/shift finance management app.

### WIP
- TIDMAS, a key-based cipher using maths.
- Kommander, a Spigot plugin that allows for remote access for admins, via the web and Discord.
- ???, a mobile app, powered by Tauri, that listens for and recognises any playing surahs in the background (like Shazam).
